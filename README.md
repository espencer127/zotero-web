# zotero-web

Making a Web UI to access my local zotero database.

Plans:
* Make it look nice
* Make it work with local files (use case: you use syncthing to get your entire zotero library directory onto your ipad, and want to browse those files with a nice UI. Maybe this involves making a whole new app actually, since webapps won't be useful if you're in offline mode.....)

How Do I Do Things?
* In the server folder, `node index.js`
* In the client folder, `npm start`
